## Basics

### Station
Station is a workplace that workers can be assigned to. Stations produce resources or perform specific tasks like mining, crafting, or refining materials. Each station has limited capacity and produces output based on the settlers assigned to it. Stations are the backbone of your settlement's productivity and can be upgraded to work more efficiently. Different station types form the foundation of your economy's supply chain.

### Settler
Settler is a worker unit that can be assigned to stations or tasks around the settlement. Settlers have limited stamina and need rest to maintain productivity. Each settler can specialize in different types of work, becoming more efficient the longer they work at a particular station. Settlers are the driving force behind your settlement's growth and must be managed carefully to prevent overwork. Without settlers, no progress can be made in expanding or maintaining your settlement.

### Settlement
Settlement is the central hub where your civilization develops and grows. It serves as the storage point for resources, housing for settlers, and a collection of interconnected stations that form your economy. Settlements expand by claiming new territory and building new stations to diversify production. The efficiency of your settlement depends on how well you balance resource production, settler assignment, and infrastructure placement. Multiple settlements can eventually be connected to form a larger network.

### Material
Material represents the raw and processed resources needed for construction, crafting, and trade. Materials are produced by stations from raw inputs (ore becomes ingot through a furnace) and consumed by other stations or settlers. Different materials have different values and uses—some are building blocks, others are fuel, and some are rare treasures. Materials flow through your settlement's economy: extracted at mines, refined at workshops, and deployed where needed. Managing your material supply and demand is crucial to preventing bottlenecks in production.
